lead_text: "A mock driving service app that was fully functional and developed by a student team. Drivers and users could connect with one another via an internet connection and see each other's geographical locations using Google Maps' API. The app was able to update in near full time, giving users an accurate reading of both parties at all times. Users could upload profile pictures that were stored on the Firebase Real-time Database and that could be seen by other users of the app."
