But as I worked on it, more features that would be nifty came to mind and I kept working to incorporate those changes. Prior to this I had no web development experience, but I learned HTML and Markdown and picked apart how the one page template I used operated. After working with the code, I've learned the ins and outs of a basic site and the result is what you see today!"
