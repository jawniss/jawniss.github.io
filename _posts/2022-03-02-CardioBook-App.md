lead_text: "A logging app where users could track and monitor their physical exercise over a period of time. Users could create a new record for their daily activities, logging data such as the date and duration, as well as any notes. All records could then be viewed, edited, or deleted at any time by the user. The records were stored in the phone's internal storage so that no data was lost between device and app restarts."
