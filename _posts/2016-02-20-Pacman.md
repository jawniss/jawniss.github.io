lead_text: "A recreation of the classic Pacman game using an Arduino Mega 2560 board. An LCD display was used for the visual output, and a joystick for Pacman's movements. The ghosts' behaviour had two modes: actively chasing the player via Euclidean distance calculations, and patrolling where it would traverse a certain section of the map in random routes."
