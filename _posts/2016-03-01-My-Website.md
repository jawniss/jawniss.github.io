lead_text: "Originally I set out just to make this website an online portfolio to always have on hand. But as I went on, more features like dark mode and embedded forms came to mind and I kept working to incorporate these ideas. Prior to this I had no web development experience, but I have since learned HTML and Markdown and picked apart how the one page template I used operated. After meticulously working with the code, I've learned the ins and outs of a basic site and the result is what you see today!"
