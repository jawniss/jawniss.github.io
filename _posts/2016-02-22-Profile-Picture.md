lead_text: "Originally a small application to test picture taking and uploading for the Driving App, this test app was built to try and create a working profile picture system. It used and accessed the Firebase Real-Time Database to store uploaded images and to retrieve the user's current profile picture when called. This app successfully performed these tasks and was implemented into the Driving App."
