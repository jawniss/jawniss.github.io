lead_text: "This Arduino project on the Mega 2560 board had a local map file loaded onto its SD card memory and used it to replicate a GPS system that was able to find nearby restaurants to the user's position marked by the red square. This was done by accessing the restaurant's locations within the SD card and calculating its relative Manhattan distance to the user. The nearby restaurants were then displayed on a window on the LCD display, and the user could select one to display a route to the restaurant on the map."
