lead_text: "A single player experience created by a student dev team, developed in the RPG Maker MV game engine. The game is turn based, where the world is frozen while you are still. When an action occurs, the world progresses one turn. Play the game to find out how a lone fisherman found himself on this island! Custom plugins were created from scratch in Javascript to add the wanted features. This project was done with multiple release deadlines, including a tech demo, beta and gold version."
