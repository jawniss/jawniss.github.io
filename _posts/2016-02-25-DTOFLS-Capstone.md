lead_text: "A LiDAR distance processing prototype that was able to determine the distance of objects from the system in real time. The range of processed objects was adjustable, and the calculated distances were displayed to the user. The prototype was created using a AD-96TOF1-EBZ Evaluation Kit, Zybo Z7 FPGA board, and Raspberry Pi 3. This project was completed for our Capstone and was given to our client at the end of the project's timeline."
