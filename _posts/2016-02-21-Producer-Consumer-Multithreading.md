lead_text: "The objective of this program is to tackle the multi-processing synchronization producer-consumer problem. A variable number of multithreaded consumers is used to simulate multiple consumers trying to simultaneously access the same data buffer. Mutual exclusion locks are used so that if the producer or a consumer is accessing the buffer, they have exclusive and uninterrupted access, preventing unintended shared data between multiple consumers. A summary of all work done and transactions are logged into log files within the project's directory."
