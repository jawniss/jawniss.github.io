lead_text: "The objective of this program was to tackle the multi-processing synchronization producer-consumer problem. A variable number of multithreaded consumers was used to simulate multiple consumers trying to access the same data buffer. Mutual exclusion locks were used so that if the producer or a consumer was accessing the buffer, they had exclusive and uninterrupted access, preventing unintended shared data between multiple consumers. A summary of all work and transactions are logged into log files within the project's directory."
