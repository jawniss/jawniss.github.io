lead_text: "Originally a small application to test picture taking and uploading capability for the Driving App, this test app was built to try and create a working profile picture system. It used and accessed the Firebase Real-Time Database to store uploaded images to the cloud and to retrieve the user's current profile picture when called. This app successfully performed these tasks and was implemented into the Driving App."
