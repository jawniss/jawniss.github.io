lead_text: "A request my friend came to me with that would help him calculate home areas for heat pump installations by automating the calculations. The app successfully finds the area of any enclosed polygon and supports data entry, for data such as the homeowner's information. I chose to use Flutter due to its multi-platform flexibility. This is my first time learning Flutter, and so all progress made is also a great learning opportunity. Goals are to add database integration to store calculations, graph points, client data, and to allow account support. This project is still in progress."
