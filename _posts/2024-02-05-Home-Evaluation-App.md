lead_text: "An idea my friend came to me with to help him measure and calculate homes for heat pump installations. The paperwork and calculations take him a few hours daily. He wants to automate this process and has asked me to develop an app to do so. The app successfully calculates the area of any enclosed polygon and supports data entry, for data such as the homeowner's information. I chose to develop this app in Flutter due to its multi-platform flexibility. This is my first time learning Flutter, and so all progress made is also a learning opportunity for me. Goals are to add database integration to store calculations, graph points, client data, and to allow account support. This project is still in progress."
