## Badminton Racquet Restringing

<p align=justify>
I offer an Edmonton racquet restringing service! I have been stringing for about 4 years now, and I was the main stringer for the University of Alberta Badminton Club for 2 years. <br>

Ask me about strings, tensions, racquets, or general court advice! Although I have never gotten formal training, I've been playing for approximately 7 years now and have learned an enormous amount from my time on court as well as my friends whom are certified coaches. Currently I'm a volunteer coach at M.E. LaZerte High School. <br>

I'm based in Northside Edmonton, and the Clareview Recreation Centre is the best place for me to meet. I can most often have your racquet back up in playing condition for you by the next day. <br>

I'm always happy to chat about anything badminton! <br>

[Please send me a message](/contactme.md) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
