- Finish posts content (github projects)

- Dark mode/light mode 
  - I think I can set variables like in _config, depending on the value of the dark/light mode toggle switch 
    change the colour of background + text

- Make second footer.html where no top button (redundant on single page screens)
  - Possibly can leave, maybe mobile looks different

- Check how site looks on mobile

- The contact page box is no border on the right cus the input box area is just a bit bigger than border perimeter
