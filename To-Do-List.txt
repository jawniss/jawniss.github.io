- Finish posts content (github projects)
- Dark mode/light mode 
  - I think I can set variables like in _config, depending on the value of the dark/light mode toggle switch 
    change the colour of background + text
- Check over about me page again, don't want it to be a huge blob
- Try to figure out Contact me page why it's slightly not perfect (contactmelayout.html)
- Make second footer.html where no top button (redundant on single page screens)
  - Possibly can leave, maybe mobile looks different
- Check how site looks on mobile
