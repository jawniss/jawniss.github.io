    <p align=justify> <font size="5"> My name is pronounced 'jawniss!' I'm a 23 year old born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I'm Cantonese, and my parents immigrated from Hong Kong. I attended the University of Alberta and graduated in Computer Engineering in April 2021. </font></p>

> <div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> <br> Throughout my undergraduate I've worked on many different types of coding projects, from app and game development to database projects. Working on a programming project is something I find extremely rewarding and enthralling, and I often find myself working nonstop on a project once I've begun. </font> </p></div>

## My hobbies

<div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> I was on the M.E. LaZerte High School badminton team, but honestly I was terrible! I loved playing, but couldn't keep up. In my first year of Uni I joined the badminton club and midway through the year things started clicking! I quickly got better, and became the Gym & Safety Officer for the club for my second, third, and final year of schooling. I've been playing for 7 years now, and my love for the sport has only grown. </font></p></div>

> <div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> <br> My strings were BG80's at 28x30lbs, but this was a fragile for me, and I was snapping them often. This pushed me into buying a stringing machine and restringing my own racquets. I've been stringing for around 4 years now, and my only regret is not starting earlier! I now use EXBOLT 63's at 25-26lbs. </font> </p></div> 
<br>
> <div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> This year I've found time to return to my high school and be a coach for the team. It's been so rewarding, sharing what I've learned on and off court with the students, seeing them slowly improve over the practices. I'm doing my best to be a patient and understanding coach, but also trying hard to be the funnest coach ;) </font></p> </div>

<br>
<br>

<div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> I'm an avid gamer! I started with the PS3 back in Junior High, and got glued to Uncharted 3. At one point someone told me I was top 1000 on the stats leaderboard! The weekend meant crashing on the couch and getting some fun games in. </font> </p> </div> 

> <div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> <br> In summer '15 I built my first PC with my pops. It was a 7 hour father-son bonding experience, and I loved every second of it. I mainly played CS:GO, getting second place in an Overklocked Gaming LAN tournament with my friends in 2018. Lost the finals to an ex-CS:GO pro, so it's a win in my books :) </font> </p> </div>
<br>
> <div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> In 2022 I've stopped playing CS:GO and moved on to Valorant, where I'm hovering at Immortal 3, trying to grace Radiant. </font> </p> </div> 

<br>
<br>

<div align=justify> <p> <font size="4"> I've grown a big affinity to cooking, especially since the start of the pandemic in 2020. I began cooking everyday with my mum, helping make every dinner for the rest of the family. What began simply as a way to help alleviate my mom's workload became an interest, where now I'm trying to learn all my mother's cooking knowledge. Soon I hope to be cooking for her! </font></p></div>
