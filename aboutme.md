Working on a programming project is something I find extremely rewarding and enthralling, and I often find myself working nonstop on a project once I've begun. </font><br>

## My hobbies

<div align=justify> <font size="4"> I was fortunate enough to join the M.E. LaZerte High School badminton team, but I was terrible at the sport. I loved playing, but couldn't keep up with the others. I joined the University of Alberta badminton club in my first year of Uni and midway through the year things started clicking! I quickly got better, and became the Gym & Safety Officer for the club for my second, third, and final year of school. I've been playing for 7 years now, and my love for the sport has only grown. </font></div>

> <font size="4" align=justify> <br> Trying new strings and tensions, I fell in love with BG80's at 28x30lbs. However, this was a fragile combo for me, and I was snapping my strings quite often. This quickly became an expensive consequence, which tempted me into buying a racquet stringing machine and restringing my own racquets. I've been stringing for around 4 years now, and my only regret is not starting earlier! </font><br>
> <font size="4" align=justify> This year I've found  time to return to M.E. LaZerte and be a badminton coach for the team. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience, sharing my knowledge and what I've learned on and off court with the students, seeing them slowly improve over the practices. I'm doing my best to be a patient and understanding coach, but also trying hard to be the funnest coach ;) </font>

<div align=justify> <font size="4">I'm an avid gamer! I started with the PS3 back in Junior High, and got glued to Uncharted 3. At one point someone told me I was top 1000 on the stats leaderboard! The weekends were amazing, crashing on the couch and getting some good games in. </font></div>

> <font size="4" align=justify> <br> Since then, in summer '15, I built my first gaming PC with my pops. It was a 7 hour journey, but it was great bonding with my dad. Thus started my PC gaming, where I mainly played CS:GO, playing an Overklocked Gaming LAN tournament and getting second place with my friends in 2018. Lost the finals to an ex-CS:GO pro, so it's a win in my books :) </font><br>
> <font size="4" align=justify> In 2022 I've stopped playing CS:GO and moved on to Valorant, where I'm hovering at Immortal 3, trying to break through to Radiant.</font>

<div align=justify> <font size="4">I've grown a big affinity to cooking, especially since the start of the pandemic in 2020. I began cooking everyday with my mum, helping make every dinner for the rest of the family. What began simply as a way to help alleviate my mom's workload became an interest, where now I'm trying to learn all my mother's cooking knowledge. </font></div>
